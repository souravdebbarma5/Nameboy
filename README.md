Sunshine is a 2007 science fiction psychological thriller film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. The movie is set in the year 2057, where a group of scientists goes on a mission to revive the dying sun. The temperature of the earth has gone too low due to dying sun. The movie explores physics, science and spirituality. It has an ensemble cast of actors like Chris Evans, Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Benedict Wong etc.

The sun is going to die soon. If the sun dies, the entire solar system will be destroyed and humanity will vanish all together. So the humans together come up with a theoretical plan to jump-start the sun again. Essentially, they mine all the fissionable material from planet earth to detonate one single explosion in the core of the sun to reignite the dying star.

It is worth noting that this came in 2007 and it's production values and depiction of scale is comparable to Gravity (2013) and Interstellar (2014). Overall, Sunshine is a must-watch if you like space exploration/adventure movies for the production values and sheer scale at which its visuals operate.

MOST UNDERRATED SCI-FI MOVIE OF ALL TIME! The soundtrack is bloodly amazing.
